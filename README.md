#  Insurance Claim Prediction Web App

This Flask-based web application allows users to **predict the likelihood of an insurance claim** being made, based on health and demographic inputs. It leverages machine learning models trained on preprocessed data to deliver real-time predictions through a simple web interface.

##  Description

Insurance claim prediction is a critical task in the healthcare insurance industry, aiming to anticipate whether a policyholder will claim insurance. This helps companies in **risk assessment, fraud detection**, and **premium pricing**.

In this project, we built a **classification model** using a sample insurance dataset. While the dataset is relatively small and slightly imbalanced, it presents a challenging yet practical problem in predictive modeling.

The model classifies whether an insurance claim is likely (`1`) or not (`0`) based on various user inputs such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and region.

##  Dataset Overview

The dataset contains the following features:

| Feature         | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `age`           | Age of the policyholder |
| `sex`           | Gender (female = 0, male = 1) |
| `bmi`           | Body Mass Index – weight in relation to height |
| `steps`         | Average walking steps per day |
| `children`      | Number of children/dependents |
| `smoker`        | Smoking status (non-smoker = 0, smoker = 1) |
| `region`        | Residential area in the US (northeast=0, northwest=1, southeast=2, southwest=3) |
| `charges`       | Medical costs billed to health insurance |
| `insuranceclaim`| Target variable: Claim made (yes = 1, no = 0) |

>  **Note**: This dataset is derived from the [Medical Cost Personal Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance) on Kaggle.

##  Machine Learning Pipeline

- **Models Used**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier

- **Data Preprocessing Includes**:
  - Handling outliers
  - One-Hot Encoding for categorical features (`sex`, `smoker`, `children`, `region`)
  - Scaling numerical values using `StandardScaler`
  - Addressing class imbalance with `SMOTE`

##  Input Features (Order-Sensitive)

The app expects the following **scaled and one-hot encoded features** in this exact order:

1. `age`  
2. `bmi`  
3. `charges`  
4. `sex_male`  
5. `smoker_yes`  
6. `children_1`  
7. `children_2`  
8. `children_3`  
9. `children_4`  
10. `region_northwest`  
11. `region_southeast`  
12. `region_southwest`

> ⚠️ Note: Features are transformed using one-hot encoding and scaled prior to model input.
